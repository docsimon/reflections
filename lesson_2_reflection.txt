What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
the .git directory is created. I need it to keep track of the changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is where the file become trackable and ready to be committed. The repository includes the working area, the staging area and the versions

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I stage the changes that logically fit together and then commit them

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branching is helpfull to experiment new features that are still unofficial. Once tested these changes can be merged in the master.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
the diagrams allow to visualize the logic and temporal sequence of the commits and to spot the commits that are not reacheable (because not part of a branch)
