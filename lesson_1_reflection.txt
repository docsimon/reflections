How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Diff shows only the differences between two files, so it's easier to find out what's wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It makes easier go back if something goes wrong with the new version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

manual commit is more flexible and gives the opportunity to logically commit the code. However
it can cause some problems if you forget to commit large part of the code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

saving multiple files in one commit is more consistent but not efficient and requires a lot of space

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows to view all the commits, while git diff allows to compare to commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It helps to fix bugs,restoring previous versions of the program

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
